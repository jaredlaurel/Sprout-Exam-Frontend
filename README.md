If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next
improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or an architectural design.
```
1. Integrate Authorization Service
    - I think the integration of an Authorization Service should be the next improvement. This not only enhances security but also ensures that only authorized users have access to the application. 

2. Adding User Confirmation Modals
    - Also, implementing user confirmation modals for actions like creating, updating, and deleting employees is a valuable user experience improvement. It prevents accidental data changes and enhances usability.
